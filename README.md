# **Python-NLP-Chatbot**

The Python NLP Chatbot is an intelligent and interactive program that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand and respond to user queries in natural language. It can be customized for various applications, such as customer support, information retrieval, or task automation.
## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all the Python packages.

NumPy: is a powerful Python library for numerical computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with an extensive collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. NumPy is widely used in scientific and data analysis applications for tasks like linear algebra, statistical computations, and numerical simulations.

```bash
pip install numpy
```
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): is a comprehensive Python library for natural language processing and text analysis. It offers a wide range of tools and resources for tasks such as tokenization, stemming, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and more. NLTK is a popular choice for developing language-based applications like chatbots, sentiment analysis systems, and language models.


```bash
pip install nltk
```

TensorFlow: is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. It provides a robust ecosystem for building and deploying machine learning models, especially deep learning models. TensorFlow offers a flexible architecture that supports both high-level APIs for quick model development and low-level APIs for customizations. It is widely used in various domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

```bash
pip install tensorflow 
```

scikit-learn: is a widely-used Python library for machine learning. It provides simple and efficient tools for data preprocessing, classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and model evaluation. scikit-learn is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, making it an excellent choice for beginners and professionals alike who want to implement machine learning algorithms with ease. It integrates well with other scientific Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas.


```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

## Usage

In NLP, "intent" refers to the purpose or goal behind a user's text or speech input. It involves categorizing the input into predefined classes representing different intentions, facilitating better interaction with NLP systems like chatbots and virtual assistants.

In intent.json file

```python
{
    "intents": [
      {
        "tag": "greeting",
        "patterns": [
          "Hi",
          "Hey",
          "How are you",
          "Is anyone there?",
          "Hello",
          "Good day"
        ],
        "responses": [
          "Hey :-), how can I help?",
          "Hi there, what can I do for you?",
          "Hi there, how can I help?"
        ]
      },
```

```bash
python chatbot_app.py 
```
Type anything in the intentions, like "Hi", and the chatbot will reply. 

## Next step

Now you can create your own chatbot!
